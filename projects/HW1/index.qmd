## Introduction

Dean Karlan at Yale and John List at the University of Chicago conducted a field experiment to test the effectiveness of different fundraising letters. They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. They published the results of this experiment in the _American Economic Review_ in 2007. The article and supporting data are available from the [AEA website](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.97.5.1774) and from Innovations for Poverty Action as part of [Harvard's Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/27853&version=4.2).

By comparing the response rates and donation amounts across the three groups, Karlan and List were able to isolate the causal effect of different fundraising strategies on donor behavior. Their findings showed that matching grants significantly increased both the likelihood of giving and the average donation amount.

This project seeks to replicate their results.

### Balance Test 

As an ad hoc test of the randomization mechanism, I provide a series of tests that compare aspects of the treatment and control groups to assess whether they are statistically significantly different from one another.

```{python}
# The following is a t-test of months since last donation to evaluate the difference between the treatment and control groups.
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

# Filter the data for treatment and control groups
treatment_group = dataf[dataf['treatment'] == 1]['mrm2'].dropna()
control_group = dataf[dataf['control'] == 1]['mrm2'].dropna()

# Perform the t-test
t_stat, p_value = ttest_ind(treatment_group, control_group, equal_var=False)

# Check if the difference is statistically significant
if p_value < 0.05:
    print(f"The groups are significantly different (t={t_stat:.2f}, p={p_value:.4f}).")
else:
    print(f"The groups are not significantly different (t={t_stat:.2f}, p={p_value:.4f}).")
```

```{python}
import pyrsm as rsm

reg1 = rsm.model.regress({"dataf": dataf}, rvar="mrm2", evar=["treatment"])
reg1.summary()
```

Note: the same p-value is observed between the two statistical tests.
Both results yield a p-value that indicates there is not a statistically significant difference between treatment and control at the 95% confidence level.

## Experimental Results

### Charitable Contribution Made

First, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation. 

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Calculate the proportion of people who donated in each group
treatment_donated_proportion = dataf[dataf['treatment'] == 1]['gave'].mean()
control_donated_proportion = dataf[dataf['control'] == 1]['gave'].mean()

# Create a barplot
bars = plt.bar(['Treatment', 'Control'], [treatment_donated_proportion, control_donated_proportion], color=['blue', 'orange'])

# Add labels to show the values for each bar
for bar in bars:
    height = bar.get_height()
    plt.text(bar.get_x() + bar.get_width() / 2, height, f'{height:.4f}', ha='center', va='bottom')

plt.ylabel('Proportion of People Who Donated')
plt.title('Proportion of People Who Donated by Group')
plt.show()
```

```{python}
```

In the following code, I perform a t-test between the treatment and control groups on the binary outcome of whether any charitable donation was made.

```{python}
treatment_gave = dataf[dataf['treatment'] == 1]['gave']
control_gave = dataf[dataf['control'] == 1]['gave']

t_stat_gave, p_value_gave = ttest_ind(treatment_gave, control_gave, equal_var=False)

if p_value_gave < 0.05:
    print(f"The groups are significantly different (t={t_stat_gave:.2f}, p={p_value_gave:.4f}).")
else:
    print(f"The groups are not significantly different (t={t_stat_gave:.2f}, p={p_value_gave:.4f}).")
```

We found a statistically significant difference between the two groups in our experiment. The difference was strong enough that it's very unlikely to have occurred by random chance alone. Based on these results., we find that the treatment had a meaningful impact on donation rates.

_todo: run a t-test between the treatment and control groups on the binary outcome of whether any charitable donation was made (you can do this as a bivariate linear regression if you want). It may help to confirm your calculations match Table 2a Panel A. Report your statistical results and interpret them in the context of the experiment (e.g., if you found a difference with a small p-value or something that was statistically significant at some threshold, what have you learned about human behavior? Use mostly English words, not numbers or stats, to explain your finding.)_

The following is a probit regression on donation outcome based on treatment/control assignment.

```{python}
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Define the outcome variable (gave) and the explanatory variable (treatment)
dataf['intercept'] = 1  # Add an intercept for the regression
explanatory_vars = ['treatment', 'intercept']
outcome_var = 'gave'

# Fit the probit model
probit_model = sm.Probit(dataf[outcome_var], dataf[explanatory_vars])
probit_results = probit_model.fit()

# Print the summary of the regression results
print(probit_results.summary())
```

_todo: run a probit regression where the outcome variable is whether any charitable donation was made and the explanatory variable is assignment to treatment or control._ 

_NOTE: Linear regression results appear replicate Table 3 column 1 in the paper. Probit results do not, despite Table 3 indicating its results come from probit regressions..._


### Differences between Match Rates

Next, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.

_todo: Use a series of t-tests to test whether the size of the match ratio has an effect on whether people donate or not. For example, does the 2:1 match rate lead increase the likelihood that someone donates as compared to the 1:1 match rate? Do your results support the "figures suggest" comment the authors make on page 8?_

_todo: Assess the same issue using a regression. Specifically, create the variable `ratio1` then regress `gave` on `ratio1`, `ratio2`, and `ratio3` (or alternatively, regress `gave` on the categorical variable `ratio`). Interpret the coefficients and their statistical precision._

_todo: Calculate the response rate difference between the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratios and the 2:1 and 3:1 ratios.  Do this directly from the data, and do it by computing the differences in the fitted coefficients of the previous regression. what do you conclude regarding the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations?_


### Size of Charitable Contribution

In this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.

_todo: Calculate a t-test or run a bivariate linear regression of the donation amount on the treatment status. What do we learn from doing this analysis?_

_todo: now limit the data to just people who made a donation and repeat the previous analysis. This regression allows you to analyze how much respondents donate conditional on donating some positive amount. Interpret the regression coefficients -- what did we learn? Does the treatment coefficient have a causal interpretation?_ 

_todo: Make two plots: one for the treatment group and one for the control. Each plot should be a histogram of the donation amounts only among people who donated. Add a red vertical bar or some other annotation to indicate the sample average for each plot._


## Simulation Experiment

As a reminder of how the t-statistic "works," in this section I use simulation to demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.

Suppose the true distribution of respondents who do not get a charitable donation match is Bernoulli with probability p=0.018 that a donation is made. 

Further suppose that the true distribution of respondents who do get a charitable donation match of any size is Bernoulli with probability p=0.022 that a donation is made.

### Law of Large Numbers

_to do:  Simulate 10,000 draws from the control distribution and 10,000 draws from the treatment distribution. You'll then calculate a vector of 10,000 differences, and then you'll plot the cumulative average of that vector of differences. This average will likely be "noisey" when only averaging a few numbers, but should "settle down" and approximate the treatment effect (0.004 = 0.022 - 0.018) as the sample size gets large. Explain the chart to the reader._


### Central Limit Theorem

_to do: Make 4 histograms at sample sizes 50, 200, 500, and 1000.  To do this for a sample size of e.g. 50, take 50 draws from each of the control and treatment distributions, and calculate the average difference between those draws. Then repeat that process 999 more times so that you have 1000 averages. Plot the histogram of those averages. The repeat for the other 3 histograms. Explain this sequence of histograms and its relationship to the central limit theorem to the reader._
